# Egg Timer

## Functionality

This is an egg timer app to boil your eggs to perfection depending on how you prefer your eggs. You can choose between soft, medium and hard eggs for cooking. The cooking progress is displayed using the progress bar. You will also hear a sound when the egg is ready.

## What I used to create this app:

* Swift Collection types - Dictionaries
* The Swift Timer API
* Conditional statements - IF/ELSE
* Functions with outputs
* The ProgressView
* AVFoundation and AVAudioPlayer
